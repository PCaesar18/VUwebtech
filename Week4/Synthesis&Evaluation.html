    <h2> To do list </h2>
      <ol>
  <li>Front matter section with the title, date of the evaluation, group number, author name(s) </li>
  <li>Introduction section providing a high-level overview of your page in terms of accessibility and/or usability (max 200 words)</li>
  <li>Accessibility highlights section providing a short discussion of what you identify to be the WCAG guidelines that are the most relevant to your page (pick 2 or 3) </li>
  <li>Improvement plan section providing a prioritized list of improvement actions to improve your page, in terms of- accessibility and usability (based on Appendix A),- other course learning goals (based on Appendix B)- the selected high lights, and the other material in the appendixes. For each item, describe what you aim to improve, and what modifications in the HTML, CSS or JavaScript are required to realize the improvement (e.g. to improve the user experience in screen readers, HTML alt tags with short texts describing the image need to be added for all img elements).</li>
  <li>Appendix A, & BTables with more detailed information as described above</li>
<li>Guideline 1.1 Text Alternatives: Provide text alternatives for any non-text content so that it can be changed into other forms people need, such as large print, braille, speech, symbols or simpler language.
Controls, Input: If non-text content is a control or accepts user input, then it has a name that describes its purpose. (Refer to Guideline 4.1 for additional requirements for controls and content that accepts user input.)

Our content is very descriptive and has lots of descriptions.

Time-Based Media: If non-text content is time-based media, then text alternatives at least provide descriptive identification of the non-text content. (Refer to Guideline 1.2 for additional requirements for media.)

No time based media.

Test: If non-text content is a test or exercise that would be invalid if presented in text, then text alternatives at least provide descriptive identification of the non-text content.

No tests.

Sensory: If non-text content is primarily intended to create a specific sensory experience, then text alternatives at least provide descriptive identification of the non-text content.

No sensory experience.

CAPTCHA: If the purpose of non-text content is to confirm that content is being accessed by a person rather than a computer, then text alternatives that identify and describe the purpose of the non-text content are provided, and alternative forms of CAPTCHA using output modes for different types of sensory perception are provided to accommodate different disabilities.

No captcha

Decoration, Formatting, Invisible: If non-text content is pure decoration, is used only for visual formatting, or is not presented to users, then it is implemented in a way that it can be ignored by assistive technology.

No decoration.


</li>
<li>Guideline 1.4 Distinguishable: Make it easier for users to see and hear content including separating foreground from background.

  1.4.1 Use of Color: Color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element. (Level A)
  Note: This success criterion addresses color perception specifically. Other forms of perception are covered in Guideline 1.3 including programmatic access to color and other visual presentation coding.

  This is true of our website.

  1.4.2 Audio Control: If any audio on a Web page plays automatically for more than 3 seconds, either a mechanism is available to pause or stop the audio, or a mechanism is available to control audio volume independently from the overall system volume level. (Level A)
Note: Since any content that does not meet this success criterion can interfere with a user's ability to use the whole page, all content on the Web page (whether or not it is used to meet other success criteria) must meet this success criterion. See Conformance Requirement 5: Non-Interference.

  No audio is played on our website.

  1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum): The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for the following: (Level AA)
Large Text: Large-scale text and images of large-scale text have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1;
Incidental: Text or images of text that are part of an inactive user interface component, that are pure decoration, that are not visible to anyone, or that are part of a picture that contains significant other visual content, have no contrast requirement.
Logotypes: Text that is part of a logo or brand name has no minimum contrast requirement.

1.4.4 Resize text: Except for captions and images of text, text can be resized without assistive technology up to 200 percent without loss of content or functionality. (Level AA)



  1.4.5 Images of Text: If the technologies being used can achieve the visual presentation, text is used to convey information rather than images of text except for the following: (Level AA)
Customizable: The image of text can be visually customized to the user's requirements;
Essential: A particular presentation of text is essential to the information being conveyed.
Note: Logotypes (text that is part of a logo or brand name) are considered essential.

all text!!

1.4.6 Contrast (Enhanced): The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 7:1, except for the following: (Level AAA)
Large Text: Large-scale text and images of large-scale text have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1;
Incidental: Text or images of text that are part of an inactive user interface component, that are pure decoration, that are not visible to anyone, or that are part of a picture that contains significant other visual content, have no contrast requirement.
Logotypes: Text that is part of a logo or brand name has no minimum contrast requirement.

1.4.7 Low or No Background Audio: For prerecorded audio-only content that (1) contains primarily speech in the foreground, (2) is not an audio CAPTCHA or audio logo, and (3) is not vocalization intended to be primarily musical expression such as singing or rapping, at least one of the following is true: (Level AAA)
No Background: The audio does not contain background sounds.
Turn Off: The background sounds can be turned off.
20 dB: The background sounds are at least 20 decibels lower than the foreground speech content, with the exception of occasional sounds that last for only one or two seconds.
Note: Per the definition of "decibel," background sound that meets this requirement will be approximately four times quieter than the foreground speech content.

1.4.8 Visual Presentation: For the visual presentation of blocks of text, a mechanism is available to achieve the following: (Level AAA)
Foreground and background colors can be selected by the user.
Width is no more than 80 characters or glyphs (40 if CJK).
Text is not justified (aligned to both the left and the right margins).
Line spacing (leading) is at least space-and-a-half within paragraphs, and paragraph spacing is at least 1.5 times larger than the line spacing.
Text can be resized without assistive technology up to 200 percent in a way that does not require the user to scroll horizontally to read a line of text on a full-screen window.

1.4.9 Images of Text (No Exception): Images of text are only used for pure decoration or where a particular presentation of text is essential to the information being conveyed. (Level AAA)
Note: Logotypes (text that is part of a logo or brand name) are considered essential.

          <li>This is not entirely relevant in our webpage, however table headers for example convey, in text, the relation between all the presented table data. Furthermore, the navigation also helps to convey the relationship and the direction of our webpage. </li>
          <li> This guideline is relevant to our webpage and we do to a great extent comply with this guideline. The CSS breaks the linear order of the webpage and therefore does not match the programmatically determined order, however this does not effect the meaning.  </li>
          <li> Our webpage complies with this guideline because on there is no statement made to anything specific on the webpage such as 'round button on the left'. This allows even visually impaired users to navigate our webpage succesfully without having to search to a specific location mentioned in the text.  </li>

        <li>2.1.1 Keyboard:  </li>
        <li> 2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap: </li>
        <li> 2.1.3 Keyboard (No Exception):</li>
       </ol>
     </td>
     <td>
       <ol>
          <li>Our webpage fully complies with this guideline but at the same time is not very relevant to our webpage. This guideline is important for interactive features such as a drag and drop feature or a drawing program. Since this kind of functionality is not present on our webpage, the guideline is not very relevant. Altough we comply with this guideline at the same time because all the  functionalities can be accessible through a keyboard.  </li>
          <li> While this guideline is difficult to test on our webpage, there could be some issues where a keyboard would get 'trapped' in a loop on our webpage. This could happen on either of the two tables on our webpage. Since they are enhanced with a Javascript function, the function could interfere with the linear flow of the webpage and disable the user of using his keyboard to operate out of the table. Again, this is a possibility but is hard to verify. </li>
          <li> This refers back to the previously mentioned guideline 2.1.1. Our website does indeed comply with the statement that all content must be operatable trough the keyboard. Altough as previously mentioned, the Javascript functionality might prove some difficulties. Nowhere on webpage is the user dependant on the path he/she takes.</li>
