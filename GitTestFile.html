          The key diffrence between the two publications is that the goal of the W3C was mainly to make the web accessible to as many people as possible while the WHATWG was focused on the general increments made HTML to create the web a place for a lot of different applications. The WHATWG sees the web as an evolving project while the W3C group is there to make recommendations and sets standards for the rest of the industry.

          The difference between the internet and the web is that the web is made of a lot of different webpages built on top of the internet. The web is built on top of the HTTP or HTTPS protocol while the internet is made from a variety of different protocols. Other applications are also working on the internet such as email services or message services.

          Tim Berners-Lee used a combination of three different technologies to create the web. One of them is the use of uniform resource locators, better known as URL's. The URL's are to link different resources with each other using an <a href="https://webfoundation.org/about/vision/history-of-the-web/"> "uniqe adress"</a>.
        Furthermore, he also used the formatting language of HyperText Markup Language (HTML) for the web as well as the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) which allows resources across the web to be retrieved.

          The main differences I can see are that the exported word document looks much more complicated than the regular HTML document.

          The strong version is prefered because it has a higher adaptability than the simply b/bold version. Furthermore, b/bold is used to as a style element and not really a content element. Therefore strong is more used to put emphasis on and can even be used inside bolded text to put extra emphasis on the specified text. HTML was not supposed to be for style and therefore strong is semantic markup. <b>For example in <strong>this</strong> paragraph</b> both bold and strong are incorporated but show up exactly the same way. Another construct that follows a similar pattern is the one for <em> em </em> and <i> i </i> where em is the better option of represention in html.

          <dt><strong>Similarity between span and div</strong></dt>
          <dd>Both span and div are used to group content in a document or page and further bring no adherent value. They both mark a section in a document </dd>
          <dt><strong>Difference between span and div</strong></dt>
          <dd>Div's are used to show larger parts of text and sections of the documents. They span entire blocks of content. Span's are used to denote smaller sections in the paragraph of document. Multiple spans can be nested inside divs, while the opposite does not hold true. </dd>

          <li>One benefit of CSS over HTML is that CSS is much more flexible than HTML and therefore allows your webpaged to be also rendered nicely on smaller devices such as smartphones.</li>
          <li>CSS also allows for the intergration of colours up to pixel precision on your webpage as well as a lot of other style elements that are much harder, or impossible to render on normal HTML webpages</li>
          <li>CSS builds on top of HTML by having selectors on specific HTML elements which can be extended with properties and values that enhance the functionality. </li>
          <li>CSS allows for the incorporation of different fonts</li>
          <li>CSS is mainly used to seperate the content from the style of the document. It allows designers to give a more user friendly feel to webpages and it makes it easier to change the style of multiple parts in your HTML document as it can be easily transferred.</li>

          <i>I would expect there to be very little difference between the two since their functionality only differs by a bit but I believe that their implementation is nearly identitical. I think that the difference would only render in a browser where both HTML functionality and CSS functionality are clearly separated. As <em>checked</em> in my browser(safari) there is indeed no visual difference to be seen. </i>

          While web browsers have been getting closer and closer to each other in performance, speed and adaptability there are still several differences to find in for example Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox. One of the key differences between the two, and also a reason why some people prefer Firefox over other browsers is that it is completely open source which allows everyone to check the underlying code. This also allows users to build a lot of extra customization on top of the Firefox web browser. Chrome has however a very wide range of possible extensions that can be added on top of the web browser as well as it being considered slightly faster than Firefox, though there is hardly any difference. Lastly, Mozilla Firefox is more privacy focused while Google (Chrome) is well known for using user data for advertisment options.

        This corresponds to the WCAG 2.0 Guideline 1.1.1. It states that: "All non-text content that is presented to the user has a text alternative that serves the equivalent purpose. "

          We used the WAVE Web Accessibility checker to check the accessibility of the Vrije Universiteit Website. What we observed is that there a lot more errors than expected (21). As mentioned in the question above, there do indeed seem to be some errors with the ALT text of some images on the website. Furthermore, some errors also come from missing links or empty forms, however most are related to the missing ALT texts.

        To our understanding, a Native App is specially created for one device on its own and often comes from places such as the App Store from Apple or the Play Store from Google. Web Apps however, have to be accessed over the internet that can only be accessed through a browser. Web Apps circumvent the need of an app marketplace.
        <dl>
          <dt><strong>Native Apps</strong></dt>
          <dd>One advantage of using native apps over web apps is that every phone is different and therefore web apps are not always very compatible whereas native apps are made much more specific for that specific smartphone.
            <br>
          One disadvantage of using native apps is that the you(the user) has to constantly keep updating the app, and if this is not done, vulnerabilities can make the smarthpone insecure. </dd>
          <dt><strong>Web Apps</strong></dt>
          <dd>One advantage of using web apps is that developers do not have to learn a new language specific for the development of their app whereas native app developers have to consider the languages that are native for that App Marketplace.
            <br>
          One disadvantage of using web apps is that it often cannot access all the functionalities that are on the smartphone and therefore could be limited in its functionality. </dd>

          Aside from the GET functionality of HTTP request methods, you also have the POST method. This method is different than the GET method in the way that it allows for a change to the web server. The method allows you to change the state of the server and not just ask for a retrieval of data. The authoritative source I used to find this information is on the developer website from the Mozilla foundation: <a href= "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods</a>
