    <h2><a id="motivation">Why Reintroduce The Headphone Jack</a></h2>

    <p>Below are several reasons why we wanted a headphone jack in our phones(in no particular order):</p>
    <ul>
        <li> We don't like being told what to do </li>
        <li> Don't you have a pair of headphones that feel like a hug from an old friend that you dont want to use with a dongle?</li>
        <li> <strong>Donglegate</strong> - <em>nuff said</em></li>
    </ul>
<p/>Below are two reasons why you should buy our phones!<p>
  <ol>
    <li> You can plug into all sorts of devices!</li>
    <li> You wont have to use bluetooth! Which is unreliable</li>
  </ol>
<h2> What happened? </h2>
<dl>
    <dt>Apple iPhone 7</dt>
    <dd>
      Apple releaed the iPhone 7 and decided that the headphone jack was not needed, they said it was courage but we all know they wanted us to buy their new wireless headphones
    </dd>

    <dt> Google Pixel <dt>
    <dd>
      Google unveiled their new pixel line to much fanfare but the lack of headphone jack was increadibly dissapointing. Their reasons for doing this were unclear, however this marked the beggining of the end of headphone jacks.
