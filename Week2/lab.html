          The key diffrence between the two publications is that the goal of the W3C was mainly to make the web accessible to as many people as possible while the WHATWG was focused on the general increments made HTML to create the web a place for a lot of different applications. The WHATWG sees the web as an evolving project while the W3C group is there to make recommendations and sets standards for the rest of the industry.

          The difference between the internet and the web is that the web is made of a lot of different webpages built on top of the internet. The web is built on top of the HTTP or HTTPS protocol while the internet is made from a variety of different protocols. Other applications are also working on the internet such as email services or message services.

          Tim Berners-Lee used a combination of three different technologies to create the web. One of them is the use of uniform resource locators, better known as URL's. The URL's are to link different resources with each other using an <a href="https://webfoundation.org/about/vision/history-of-the-web/"> "uniqe adress"</a>.
        Furthermore, he also used the formatting language of HyperText Markup Language (HTML) for the web as well as the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) which allows resources across the web to be retrieved.

        The main difference is that the libreoffice export automatically includes some css and some other metadata to make sure that whatever you type into libreoffice can be published online very easily. Great feature for writers that dont want to learn html and just want to put their thoughts online.</p>

          The strong version is prefered because it has a higher adaptability than the simply b/bold version. Furthermore, b/bold is used to as a style element and not really a content element. Therefore strong is more used to put emphasis on and can even be used inside bolded text to put extra emphasis on the specified text. HTML was not supposed to be for style and therefore strong is semantic markup. <b>For example in <strong>this</strong> paragraph</b> both bold and strong are incorporated but show up exactly the same way. Another construct that follows a similar pattern is the one for <em> em </em> and <i> i </i> where em is the better option of represention in html.

          <dt><strong>Difference between span and div</strong></dt>
          <dd>Div's are used to show larger parts of text and sections of the documents. They span entire blocks of content. Span's are used to denote smaller sections in the paragraph of document. Multiple spans can be nested inside divs, while the opposite does not hold true. </dd>

          <li>One benefit of CSS over HTML is that CSS is much more flexible than HTML and therefore allows your webpaged to be also rendered nicely on smaller devices such as smartphones.</li>
          <li>CSS also allows for the intergration of colours up to pixel precision on your webpage as well as a lot of other style elements that are much harder, or impossible to render on normal HTML webpages</li>
          <li>CSS builds on top of HTML by having selectors on specific HTML elements which can be extended with properties and values that enhance the functionality. </li>
          <li>CSS allows for the incorporation of different fonts</li>
          <li>CSS is mainly used to seperate the content from the style of the document. It allows designers to give a more user friendly feel to webpages and it makes it easier to change the style of multiple parts in your HTML document as it can be easily transferred.</li>

          <i>I would expect there to be very little difference between the two since their functionality only differs by a bit but I believe that their implementation is nearly identitical.

As <em>checked</em> in my browser(safari) there is indeed no visual difference to be seen. </i>

          While web browsers have been getting closer and closer to each other in performance, speed and adaptability there are still several differences to find in for example Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox. One of the key differences between the two, and also a reason why some people prefer Firefox over other browsers is that it is completely open source which allows everyone to check the underlying code. This also allows users to build a lot of extra customization on top of the Firefox web browser. Chrome has however a very wide range of possible extensions that can be added on top of the web browser as well as it being considered slightly faster than Firefox, though there is hardly any difference. Lastly, Mozilla Firefox is more privacy focused while Google (Chrome) is well known for using user data for advertisment options.

As mentioned in the question above, there do indeed seem to be some errors with the ALT text of some images on the website. Furthermore, some errors also come from missing links or empty forms, however most are related to the missing ALT texts.

        To our understanding, a Native App is specially created for one device on its own and often comes from places such as the App Store from Apple or the Play Store from Google. Web Apps however, have to be accessed over the internet that can only be accessed through a browser. Web Apps circumvent the need of an app marketplace.

          <dt><strong>Native Apps</strong></dt>
          <dd>One advantage of using native apps over web apps is that every phone is different and therefore web apps are not always very compatible whereas native apps are made much more specific for that specific smartphone.
            <br>
          One disadvantage of using native apps is that the you(the user) has to constantly keep updating the app, and if this is not done, vulnerabilities can make the smarthpone insecure. </dd>
          <dt><strong>Web Apps</strong></dt>
          <dd>One advantage of using web apps is that developers do not have to learn a new language specific for the development of their app whereas native app developers have to consider the languages that are native for that App Marketplace.

          The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is heavily focused on creating access for all on the Web. I was not able to find where the link to this question pointed to so I found a presentation and used that. One key point is standardizing unicode normalizaition in every language. Espeically the languages that are not from latin descent such a arabic, russian and basically all of Asia. Standards support for web resource identifiers, such as DNS systems or IDN systems. Basically everything that uses english needs to have an equivalent in other languages and these changes need to be internchangable with each other in a seamless fashion. Also providing supoprt for language tags. This will be done by using ISO 639 language codes and ISO 3166 country codes.
          Providing support for speech synthesis for markup language. Providing suport for hyphenation! Support for vertical text or other types of text that are not english. Standards webfonts. Providing support for date and time since russia uses different time altogether. In addition US notes down their times in a very different manner which can cause a lot of confusion (this is an open topic accross all of computing and buisness in general) even on paper it is confusing. Suport for the mobile web for developing society. DIfferent web fonts for differet languuages. Support for opentype and ruby.

          The server running the website <a href= "http://www.few.vu.nl">http://www.few.vu.nl</a> has the IP adress: <strong>ww.few.vu.nl./130.37.164.154</strong>.
          <br>
          The website <a href= "http://www.cs.vu.nl">http://www.cs.vu.nl</a> has the corresponding IP adress of: <strong>apac012.vu.nl./130.37.164.154</strong>
          I found the answer using an online IP address finder, namely <a href= "https://www.site24x7.com/find-ip-address-of-web-site.html">https://www.site24x7.com/find-ip-address-of-web-site.html</a>.
          <br>
          They are very useful and allow a quick way to discover an IP address. However, some issues that arise is that this is a very easy way to discover a lot of information easily about the server or website. For personal servers, this would have a lot of associated privacy issues that would need to be resolved. Furthermore, since a packet is sent and a response is made in order to find the IP adress, it is also possible to create an overflow of packet requests and that could theoretically render the server useless in the end.

          Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) is a new update from the version 4 protocol. This protocol allows packets to be send and recieved between two different areas(nodes) of the network. First of all, the new IPv6 version allows the creation of a lot more unique IP addresses than the previous version. The number of bits reserved for the addresses goes from 32 in IPv4 to 128 in IPv6. This would help the Internet of Things (IoT) markets as well as to allow even more people and devices access to the internet. Furthermore, IPv6 is also more secure than its predecessor in the way that it promotes the establishing of encryption and stops/prevents packet spoofing.
          IPv6 also handles packages faster and more efficiently than IPv4 which could free the way for a more streamlined connection and less cluttering.

          MIME types stand for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension. They help to specify the contents of the specific document or file. Most file types are standardized by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). Some of the most common subtypes of "text" are:
          <ul>
            <li>text/css</li>
            <li>text/html</li>

          Aside from the GET functionality of HTTP request methods, you also have the POST method. This method is different than the GET method in the way that it allows for a change to the web server. The method allows you to change the state of the server and not just ask for a retrieval of data. The authoritative source I used to find this information is on the developer website from the Mozilla foundation: <a href= "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods</a>
