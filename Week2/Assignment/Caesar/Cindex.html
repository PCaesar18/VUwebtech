            <p>Below are several reasons why we wanted a headphone jack in our phones(in no particular order)</p>
            <ul class="lists">
              <li> We don't like being told what to do </li>
              <li> Don't you have a pair of headphones that feel like a hug from an old friend that you dont want to use with a dongle?</li>
              <li> <strong>Donglegate</strong> - <em>nuff said</em></li>

                <dd>
                  Apple releaed the iPhone 7 and decided that the headphone jack was not needed, they said it was courage but we all know they wanted us to buy their new wireless headphones

                  Google unveiled their new pixel line to much fanfare but the lack of headphone jack was increadibly dissapointing. Their reasons for doing this were unclear, however this marked the beggining of the end of headphone jacks.

      <h2> Browser Compatability Report</h2>
        <p class="browser">
          In order to learn html and css we followed the internetingishard.com tutorial. This was very easy to follow and was primarily done by only sticking to examples which are applicable to firefox. The site looks pretty much identical on all the different browsers (safari, chrome, firefox) except for the store hours box. This is probably becuase the website is increadibly simple and we intentionally avoided doing complex nestings of elements. There are also no errors (only warnings) from the validator. This store hours box appears to be a nudged slightly lower on safari and chrome than it does on firefox. This could be alleviated by increaseing the size of the footer_item with a higher height percentage. Another option would be to change the margins on the table.hours css element to make it fit better inside. Apart from that, the rules that interpret the very simple html we wrote must be the implemented in the same manner across the different browers. With increasibly more complex elements or nesting or elements the rules are probably interpreted differently and thus compatability issues arise. This must be the case for sliders or highly interactive javascript content.
