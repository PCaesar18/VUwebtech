    <h1>A4: Assignment "Synthesis & Evaluation" </h1>
    <h2> To do list </h2>
      <ol>
  <li>Front matter section with the title, date of the evaluation, group number, author name(s) </li>
  <li>Introduction section providing a high-level overview of your page in terms of accessibility and/or usability (max 200 words)</li>
  <li>Accessibility highlights section providing a short discussion of what you identify to be the WCAG guidelines that are the most relevant to your page (pick 2 or 3) </li>
  <li>Improvement plan section providing a prioritized list of improvement actions to improve your page, in terms of- accessibility and usability (based on Appendix A),- other course learning goals (based on Appendix B)- the selected high lights, and the other material in the appendixes. For each item, describe what you aim to improve, and what modifications in the HTML, CSS or JavaScript are required to realize the improvement (e.g. to improve the user experience in screen readers, HTML alt tags with short texts describing the image need to be added for all img elements).</li>
  <li>Appendix A, & BTables with more detailed information as described above</li>
<li>Guideline 1.1 Text Alternatives: Provide text alternatives for any non-text content so that it can be changed into other forms people need, such as large print, braille, speech, symbols or simpler language.
Controls, Input: If non-text content is a control or accepts user input, then it has a name that describes its purpose. (Refer to Guideline 4.1 for additional requirements for controls and content that accepts user input.)

Time-Based Media: If non-text content is time-based media, then text alternatives at least provide descriptive identification of the non-text content. (Refer to Guideline 1.2 for additional requirements for media.)

Test: If non-text content is a test or exercise that would be invalid if presented in text, then text alternatives at least provide descriptive identification of the non-text content.

Sensory: If non-text content is primarily intended to create a specific sensory experience, then text alternatives at least provide descriptive identification of the non-text content.

CAPTCHA: If the purpose of non-text content is to confirm that content is being accessed by a person rather than a computer, then text alternatives that identify and describe the purpose of the non-text content are provided, and alternative forms of CAPTCHA using output modes for different types of sensory perception are provided to accommodate different disabilities.

Decoration, Formatting, Invisible: If non-text content is pure decoration, is used only for visual formatting, or is not presented to users, then it is implemented in a way that it can be ignored by assistive technology.


</li>
<li>Guideline 1.4 Distinguishable: Make it easier for users to see and hear content including separating foreground from background.</li>
<li>Guideline 2.4 Navigable: Provide ways to help users navigate, find content, and determine where they are.</li>

          <li>This is not entirely relevant in our webpage, however table headers for example convey, in text, the relation between all the presented table data. Furthermore, the navigation also helps to convey the relationship and the direction of our webpage. </li>
          <li> This guideline is relevant to our webpage and we do to a great extent comply with this guideline. The CSS breaks the linear order of the webpage and therefore does not match the programmatically determined order, however this does not effect the meaning.  </li>
          <li> Our webpage complies with this guideline because on there is no statement made to anything specific on the webpage such as 'round button on the left'. This allows even visually impaired users to navigate our webpage succesfully without having to search to a specific location mentioned in the text.  </li>

     <td> Guideline 2.1 Keyboard Accessible: Make all functionality available from a keyboard.
       <ol>
        <li>2.1.1 Keyboard:  </li>
        <li> 2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap: </li>
        <li> 2.1.3 Keyboard (No Exception):</li>
       </ol>
     </td>
     <td>
       <ol>
          <li>Our webpage fully complies with this guideline but at the same time is not very relevant to our webpage. This guideline is important for interactive features such as a drag and drop feature or a drawing program. Since this kind of functionality is not present on our webpage, the guideline is not very relevant. Altough we comply with this guideline at the same time because all the  functionalities can be accessible through a keyboard.  </li>
          <li> While this guideline is difficult to test on our webpage, there could be some issues where a keyboard would get 'trapped' in a loop on our webpage. This could happen on either of the two tables on our webpage. Since they are enhanced with a Javascript function, the function could interfere with the linear flow of the webpage and disable the user of using his keyboard to operate out of the table. Again, this is a possibility but is hard to verify. </li>
